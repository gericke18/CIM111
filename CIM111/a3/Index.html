<div class="avengers">
<h3>Avenger/Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3>
<p>Role/Responsibility: Since I was unfrozen from my suspended animation in the arctic, I have served as the leader of the Avengers.  I serve a variety of purposes, being the tactical leader but also the emotional anchor on the team.  It was also important for me to remain level headed in a team with so many big egos.</p>

<h2>Special Skills</h2>
<div class="other">
<p>My time training in the army has instilled in me a variety of skills.  There are the more excentric skills, like loading a gun, navigation, and hand to hand combat, but these come second to the valuable mental skills I developed. When I led hundreds of U.S. soldiers on a raid on a Hydra base, it taught me how to be a leader, a skill I translated to the 21st century when I led the Avengers against an Alien invasion.  It taught me how to be brave, as I learned when I stormed a Hydra base and freed many of my men.  Finally, it taught me the value of sacrifice, when I plunged a plane loaded with nukes into the arctic, resulting in me spending 70 years in suspended animation.</p>
